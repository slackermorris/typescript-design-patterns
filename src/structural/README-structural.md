## Structural Patterns

- [Composite](./composite/README-composite.md): compose zero or more similar objects so they can be manipulated as one object.
- [Composite With Iterator]('./composite-with-iterator/README-composite-with-iterator.md): use the Iterator pattern to traverse children on the composite object.
