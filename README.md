## 🏗️ Structural Patterns

> _Patterns that deal with object composition and relationships_

### 📦 Composite

Compose zero or more similar objects so they can be manipulated as one unified object.

**→ [Read the full guide](./src/structural/composite/README-composite.md)**

---

### 🔗 Composite with Iterator

Combine the Composite pattern with Iterator for powerful tree traversal capabilities.

**→ [Read the full guide](./src/structural/composite-with-iterator/README-composite-with-iterator.md)**

---

## 🔄 Behavioural Patterns

> _Patterns that focus on communication between objects_

### 🔁 Iterator

Allows sequential traversal through a complex data structure without exposing its internal details.

**→ [Read the full guide](./src/behavioural/iterator/README-iterator.md)**
